"Physical Fitness is the first requisite of happiness" - Joseph Pilates
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Heart disease is caused by obesity and poor lifestyle choices. Sometimes heart diseases can be hereditary as well. Needless to say, it is important to maintain good heart health. The aim of this project is to develop a reliable machine learning model to determine whether a patient will need to visit a physician and whether a patient is developing an underlying heart condition. 
\\
Health care are of two types :-
\\1. Reactive Health care, and
\\2. Preventive Health care
\\While Reactive health care is given when symptoms of a disease is observed, Preventive health care stops conditions from occurring. Doctors agree that preventive health care is cheaper and better than reactive health care. It is easier to keep people healthy rather than curing a disease.
\\ 
In India, often times a patient may not be able to access proper preventative health care. This may be due to lack of  time or money. Furthermore, experienced doctors in India are scarce and have a long queues of patients. A patient might not want preventive health care in such situations as it is difficult and time consuming to schedule an appointment with the doctor.  
\\
The project discussed in this report tries to address this issue. The system encourages people to take the path of preventive health care rather than reactive health care by making the former more accessible with respect to time and money. Heart Diseases can be monitored in their initial stages and can help prevent further complications. Lastly, this project has been developed for people to maintain a healthy lifestyle.


\section{Motivation}
to provide cheaper healthcare for the general public
to encourage preventative healthcare 
to provide time and a good user experience to patients
lack of automated systems to diagnoze diseases in people
